## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges that I had with this app are build.gradle, android manifest, and ANdroid Studio version issues. I was following the video tutorial, which has an older version API than me, so for some libraries, I was using android when I should have been using androidx. With the help of an TA, I was able to convert all the old libraries to new ones. I also had an issue with my emulator, which kept crashing when I tried to run the app. I tried restarting the emulator, Android Studio, and created a new emulator, but it didn't work. AFter going to the TA, I found out that one of the users I created didn't exist, so I was getting a null pointer exception. In general, alongside these problem and the usual slowness and glitchiness of Android Studio, I was able to successfully complete the project!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some challenges that I faced with this app is that I had issues with logging into my app, trying to get my post recognized by the Back4App websites, and dealing with different issues regarding my version of Android Studio, alongside the typical struggle of dealing with the slowness and the glitching screen. Eventually, I was able to finally overcome these problems and finish the app!
